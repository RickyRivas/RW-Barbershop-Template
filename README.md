#East Side Blends Barbershop (deprecated source code)
One of my first websites that I built with html, css/scss and vanilla javascript. This is an old repository of that website's source code. I designed and developed an entirely new website that looks much more professional and follows web design principles. You can visit it at https://rwt1.netlify.app

#Tech stack
I credit this barbershop with helping me master my html and css skills. The only javascript was for the navigation toggle. The new version has much more javascript, advanced CSS and semantic HTML.
